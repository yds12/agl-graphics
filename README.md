# AGL Graphics

AGL Graphics is a library used to deal with image manipulation. It depends on [AGL](http://github.com/yds12/agl).

## Compiling and Installing AGL Graphics

First install the basic [AGL](http://github.com/yds12/agl). Now, open a terminal, `cd` to the directory `src` and type:

```
make install
```

That's it! If you want to use AGL Graphics for development, you can type `make install_debug` instead, to install it with debug symbols.
